v1.4 Update
- Re-coded the print sequence to fix an issue where the Android print spooler was failing to open.
- Refactored HTML structure to allow the print modal to flatten seamlessly for mobile printing.
- Updated the log array to use underscores (e.g., v1_0.txt) to prevent web browsers from confusing file names with file extensions.
