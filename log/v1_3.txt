v1.3 Update
- Moved the Print feature into a dedicated popup window (modal).
- Added a simple "Include Archives" toggle directly inside the Print window.
- Cleaned up the print view so it only shows formatted text for tasks (Complete, In Progress, Not Started).
- Connected the Change Updates log to pull dynamically from external .txt files.
